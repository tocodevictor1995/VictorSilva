            <h3>Victor Silva</h3>
            <p>Hey, guys! My name is Victor Silva and I am pleased to introduce myself to you. I am 28 years old and currently studying a career in Systems Development. When I'm not programming or studying, I like to have barbecues with friends and get my family together to watch movies and TV series. Speaking of family, I am proudly married and the proud father of a 6-month-old son named Ravi.

                Although I currently work at a glass manufacturing company, I am studying hard to change careers. I'm passionate about web design and I'm studying the subject. I believe learning about web design and related careers will open up interesting opportunities for me in the future.
                
                I was born into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, just as my mother was born into the church, I find great inspiration in the scriptures. One of my favorite verses is Doctrine and Covenants 88:22, which says, “For he that is not able to fulfill the law of a heavenly kingdom cannot endure the heavenly glory.” It reminds me of the importance of living a fair and fulfilling life.</p>
